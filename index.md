{% include youtube-player.html id="8EqQc93Jzaw" %}

Game Show Studio lets you host your own trivia game show in your home, classroom, or workplace. It gives you everything you need to put on a stunning and interactive show, including sound effects, graphics that can be displayed on a television, and an easy way for players to buzz in wirelessly using their iOS devices. All you need to do is gather up some trivia questions you would like to ask (from an existing trivia game, your classroom materials, or online) and get the app, then you’ll be ready to play.

# Connecting Devices and Buzzing In

Game Show Studio can connect iPhone and iPad devices using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. When a player joins a game, his/her screen becomes a button which can be tapped to buzz in, sending a wireless signal to the host’s device, which will play a sound and indicate which player buzzed in first. Do you have more players than iOS devices? No problem! You can let up to four players use the same device to buzz in. In this case, the screen will be divided into sections so that each player on the device can buzz in by tapping their region of the screen.

# Graphics, Sound Effects, and Music

All good game shows have exciting graphics, music, and sound effects. Thanks to this app, the game show that you host will be no different. As soon as you download this app and enter hosting mode, you will be able to play music and sound effects, specifically created for use in a game show, including:

* A theme song,
* Background songs that you can play while you read questions or while you are introducing a new round of play,
* Short clips of transition music, and
* Ambient sound.

All of this enables you to give the players of your game an exciting and immersive experience.

Other sound effects play automatically throughout the game so that you, the host, can concentrate on keeping up a fast-paced game. Whenever a player buzzes in, for instance, a sound is played, providing immediate feedback to the host and the players.

If you connect the host’s device to an external display (like an Apple TV), you can show useful game information to all the players in the room. The display includes the names of all players of each team, the score of each team, and the customizable timer that counts down when a player buzzes in. This also makes it easy for everyone in the room to see clearly who buzzed in first. While this adds even more to the complete “Studio” effect, an external display is not required; all of this information is also displayed to the host on his/her device.

# Gameplay

The host has the ability to customize gameplay in many different ways. Teams can be arranged in a variety of ways, to allow many different styles of play. The game supports up to six teams, and each team can have up to twelve players. This enables such configurations as:

* Six players, each on their own team (every person for him/herself),
* Two teams of three,
* Five teams of two,
* A team of ten against a single person,
* And many more.

Other customizable features include:

* The number of points awarded for correct answers,
* The number of points taken away for incorrect answers (zero is an option),
* The amount of time a player has to answer a question after buzzing in, and
* The color of each team (represented both on the host’s device and on an optional external display).

# Number of devices

Game Show Studio officially supports up to five player devices connected to a host in Bluetooth LE mode. Since each device enables up to four people to play, up to 20 players are officially supported. It is likely that more devices would be able to connect (so the app enables connection attempts to more than five player devices), but doing so has not been thoroughly tested.

If the compatibility networking mode is used (to support devices that do not have Bluetooth LE, such as iPad 2), Game Show Studio officially supports a host connecting to up to four player devices.

# What's Included

This app includes everything you need to create an immersive game show experience, as described above. It does not, however, include any trivia or academic questions. This allows hosts to use any questions they want. Questions can be found from an existing trivia source (there are many available as board games, including themed trivia), or teachers can use academic materials if they wish to use the app in their classrooms. A host can prepare themed trivia for a New Year’s party or a bridal shower. There are many exciting possibilities for question themes.

# Cost

Downloading Game Show Studio is free. Players can join games for free. In order to support the developer of the app, hosting a game requires an In-App Purchase. You will have an opportunity to try all the hosting features before you buy, including connecting to players, playing sounds/music, allowing players to buzz in, and connecting to an external display. And if you decide you want to host a full game, only you have to make the purchase; your friends can download the app on their devices and connect to your game for free.
