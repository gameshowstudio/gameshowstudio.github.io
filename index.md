# Wireless Trivia Buzzers

Game Show Studio turns your iPhone or iPad devices into a wireless buzzer system by allowing you to connect a host's device with one or more devices to be used by players.

* **One Host Device:** One device is used by the host, which can display trivia questions, player names, team scores, music controls, and more.
* **One or More Player Devices:** Players use one or more devices to wirelessly connect to the host. One device can be used by up to four players to buzz in.
* **TV Display (Optional):** Connect the host's device to a TV via HDMI or AirPlay to show the game board and play sound effects for an exciting and immersive game show experience. If a TV is not available, sounds and music play from the host's device.
