We’re proud of this app, and we put a lot of thought into the experience. This page points out a few of the smaller details that add that extra bit of polish to Game Show Studio.

## App Launch Animation

The app was designed so that the icon and initial screen have the same elements in the same location. This makes for a fluid experience when the user launches the app from the iOS home screen, and the app icon zooms to fill the screen (the default iOS 7/8 launch animation).

## Responsive Host Screen

A lot of thoughtful consideration went into finding the best way to give the host clear access to the most important controls while they host a game. Naturally, the best solution was different depending on device size. Hosting on iPad offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for assigning players to teams, taking advantage of the screen space to make all players visible all the time. On iPhone, the limited screen space made a context switch necessary for team assignments (this option can be accessed through the “Game Options” menu). These details help to make the hosting experience smooth and seamless, regardless of which device is used.

## Player Screen

The goal for the players’ buzz in screen was to provide the biggest possible touch area for buzzers while still providing the players with options to leave the game or change their names. This meant that the configuration of the screen did not need to change with the device size; whatever size the user has will be filled with one or more buttons.

The configuration does change slightly, though, based on how many players are using the device. If there are only one or two players on the device, the option buttons appear at the top of the screen. With three or four players, though, it’s probable that players would be gathered around the device, meaning that allowing the players to tap all the way to any edge (including the top) to buzz in would be ideal. In that case, the option buttons are located in the center of the screen, at the intersection of all of the buttons, where players would be unlikely to tap. This provides a great experience for players regardless of how many people are sharing a device.
