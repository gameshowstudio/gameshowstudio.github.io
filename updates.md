The next release of Game Show Studio is coming soon, and it is packed with new features that will help you create a more exciting game show experience.

**Free Upgrade:** Customers who purchased Hosting Mode in version 1 will get a free upgrade to Hosting Mode in version 2.

## Question Sets

Game Show Studio now comes with questions to use in your trivia game. Choose from built-in question sets or create your own.

There is a new Questions Pane on both iPhone and iPad. On iPhone, the pane fills the entire main area of the screen. Note that while there are players assigned to teams, the [Host Info View](#host-info-view) will be visible so that the scores and buzz-in status are always available to the host.

On iPad, the Questions Pane is visible in conjunction with the Teams Panel, in addition to the A/V Panel:

#### Question Set Editor

It's easy to write your own question sets with Game Show Studio's built-in Question Set Editor:

#### External Questions

Use of the new Questions Pane is optional. Game Show Studio still works great for games where the host wants to use trivia questions from a source external to the app (such as trivia board games or academic materials).

## Timed Round

The host can now include a new kind of round that makes for a dramatic ending to a game. The fast-paced [Timed Round](/help/timedround) includes an exciting introduction and new sound effects that helps the host create a thrilling game show experience. Check out the video to learn more.

## Host Control Panes

Commonly used game controls are now easier to access than ever, and new controls have been added to give the host more control over the game show experience. There are six Host Control Panes:

* The Teams Pane: This pane shows which players are on which teams, the scores, and which player has buzzed in. The style of this pane varies based on which device is being used (iPhone or iPad).
* [The Questions Pane](#question-sets): Shows the questions in the currently selected set and allows the host to select between various question sets.
* The Music Pane: When this pane is visible, the host is one tap away from playing a song at any time. [Volume mixers](#music-and-audio-mixers) are now available in version 2.0.
* The Sound Pane: This pane allows the host to play sounds during the game and to [customize the volume](#music-and-audio-mixers) of the sounds that are played automatically during the game.
* The TV Pane: The host can control what's displayed on the TV from the [TV Pane](#television-display-options).
* The Round Rules Pane: The rules of the round can be customized from this pane.

*What Has Changed?*

* In version 1, the only pane that was always visible was the Teams Pane.
* The ability to play music was accessible through a popover display that disappeared when a track was selected (the Music Pane is now persistent in version 2, and it offers volume mixers).
* The round rules display was a separate screen in version 1. In version 2, the Round Rules Pane is better integrated and easier to use.
* All of the other panes (the Questions Pane, the Sound Pane, and the TV Pane) are brand new to version 2, and offer the host new options that were previously not available.

On iPhone, only one of the six panes can be visible at a time. Notice that on all panes except the Teams Pane, the [Host Info View](#host-info-view) appears so that the host can know the scores and buzz-in status at all times:

On iPad, there are three panes visible at all times. The Teams Pane is always visible. The A/V Panel allows the host to display the Music Pane, the Sound Pane, or the TV Pane. The Utility Panel allows the host to display the Questions Pane or the Round Rules Pane.

In the following image, the Teams Pane is purple, the A/V Panel is yellow, and the Utility Panel is green:

## Host Info View

On iPad, the teams and scores are always visible on the main host screen. On iPhone, other panes (like the Music Pane or the Questions Pane) take the place of the Teams Pane when they are visible. To make sure that the host always has access to relevant information, an informational view appears to show the current scores whenever there are players on teams and the Teams Pane is not visible. When a player buzzes in, this informational panel animates to show which player buzzed in. This way, the host can stay on a pane other than the Teams Pane (such as the Questions Pane) throughout the entire game. This informational view is pictured below, where you can see what it looks like in its default state, and in the state where a player has buzzed in.

## Easier Score Updates

### Quick Score Corrections

{: .floatRight }
![score corrections](/images/v2-0-0/scoring-correction.png){:width="230px"}

New in version 2.0, the host can easily make scoring adjustments based on the round rules. Tapping a team's score will display an easy-to-use panel that offers one-touch access to common scoring changes (add or subtract correct points or incorrect points). Free-form score editing is also still available.

### Award or Penalize Players with Sound Anytime

{: .floatRight }
![score updates with sound](/images/v2-0-0/score-change-with-sound.png){:width="230px"}

Tap on any team's score to reveal buttons to award or penalize a team and play the corresponding sound. This is great for asking on-the-fly questions or for questions that the host wants to let a team answer collaboratively.

## Television Display Options

Version 2.0 gives the host control over more aspects of the TV display, in addition to displaying title cards and a victory animation. Learn more on the [TV Page](/help/tv).

*What Has Changed?* In version 1, there was a TV display, but no customization options.

## Music and Audio Mixers

The volume of the songs available on the Music Pane can be customized on a per-track basis.

![music mixers](/images/v2-0-0/music-pane-mixers.png){:width="230px"}

If the mixers don't appear, scroll to the bottom of the Music Pane and make sure that the "Show Volume Mixers" switch is in the on position.

Sound effect volume can also be customized on a per-sound effect basis in the Sound Pane:
