Downloading Game Show Studio is free. Joining games as a player is free. For a limited time, we are pleased to make Hosting Mode and all question sets available to all users without requiring an in-app purchase.

We recognize that during a global pandemic, the number of contexts where Game Show Studio can be used is smaller, since there are risks associated with gathering people together in the same room. We also recognize that there are groups of people gathered in the same place already (such as people living together), and that Game Show Studio is a great way to spend time together when that can be done safely.

We want to make it easy for people who are already safely in the same place to use [this new and exciting version of Game Show Studio](/updates/3-0) together. Please enjoy all of the features of the app for free for a limited time.
