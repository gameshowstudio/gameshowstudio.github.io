            New in version 3, the host can prepare a game before getting everyone together to play, so that host can transition easily from one round to the next. Rounds in prepared games can have preplanned rules (e.g. scoring and timing rules) and question sets. Learn more about how to use Prepared Games <a href="/help/preparedgames">here</a>.

### Reorganized and Responsive Host Screen

Game Show Studio 3 provides a great hosting experience, regardless of the host's device's screen size.

On iPad, the host can take advantage of the large screen to have one-touch access to all of the game's important controls and the most expansive view of game information:

Or, the host can use split screen to have another app on the screen at the same time. In larger layouts, all of the controls remain visible, but the Teams Pane is moved to the top of the screen to make more space horizontally:

In smaller split screen views, the control panes get organized into a tab view, for quick access to the Questions Pane, Music Pane, Sound Pane, and TV Pane, as needed. The Teams Pane always remains visible, so that the host can have quick access to scores and to see who buzzed in:

iPhone provides a great hosting experience, as well, and has a layout that is similar to the small split screen view on the iPad on larger phones, and yet another layout on smaller phones:

### Redesigned Player Screens

The Player Screens were redesigned with a fresh, new look, and are designed to maximize the tap area for players to buzz in, regardless of whether one player is using a device, or multiple players are using a device.
