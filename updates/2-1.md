New in Version 2.1: 3D Touch Support.

* Quick Score Edit: Use a 3D Touch on a team to quickly access the free-form score edit panel. The Team Detail Screen is still available using a regular (non-3D) touch to get access to the [quick score updates](/updates/2-0/#easier-score-updates).
* Home Screen Quick Actions: Now you can get access to Hosting Mode or Player Mode using a 3D Touch from the iPhone Home screen.
