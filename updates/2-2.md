Version 2.2 includes multiple enhancements to the Music Pane, including:

* A new song collection called Clouds.
* The Play button becomes a Pause button on the Music Pane while a song is playing. Tap this button once to smoothly fade out a song. Tap it twice to stop a song immediately. The other Pause button remains visible at all times, for easy access even when the Music Pane is not showing.
* Visual improvements when a song or sound effect is tapped.
