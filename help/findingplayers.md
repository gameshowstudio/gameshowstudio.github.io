To begin a game with Game Show Studio, you will two or more iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch) running Game Show Studio: one device to host, and one or more devices to play. Game Show Studio is free to download, and players can join a host's game for free.

The following video shows how to connect to players and begin a game:

## Finding Players Later in the Game

When you enter Hosting Mode, the Find Players screen appears automatically. You can return to this screen later by tapping the Game Options button at the top of the Host screen, then tapping Find Players.

## Fixing Connection Problems

If you have trouble connecting:

* Ensure that both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are turned on for all devices (host and players). You can do this using [Control Center](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202769){:target="_blank<!-- markup clean_ -->"}.
* Bring the player devices closer to the host's device (the connection should work from 300 feet away or more, but the distance and reliability can vary based on a number of factors).
* Reset the connection on both the host's device and the players' devices.
    * On the host's Find Players screen, tap the "Reset Connection" button.
    * On the players' "Not Connected to Host" screen, tap the "Reset Connection" button (which appears after several seconds).
* If none of the options listed above work, try to [force Game Show Studio to quit](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330){:target="_blank<!-- markup clean_ -->"}, then relaunch it on all devices (host and players).

## About the Networking Modes

Host devices that support Bluetooth Low Energy (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 3rd generation or newer, iPod Touch 5th generation or newer) can select between two networking modes:

* Reliable Networking Mode: This mode uses Bluetooth Low Energy to connect devices, which maintains connections better and usually provides faster device-to-device communication. This mode requires all player devices to support Bluetooth Low Energy.
* Compatibility Mode: This mode uses a combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to connect devices, and allows older devices (such as iPad 2 devices) to participate in games.

The host can switch to Compatibility Mode by tapping "Don't See Who You're Looking For?" on the Find Players screen. If the host is already in Compatibility Mode, there will be an option to "Switch Back to Reliable Networking Mode" instead. If the host's device does not support Bluetooth Low Energy, it will be in Compatibility Mode by default, and there will not be an option to change it.
