To begin a game with Game Show Studio, you will need more than one iOS device (iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch) running Game Show Studio: one device to host, and one or more devices to play. Game Show Studio is free to download and players can join a host's game for free.

The following video demonstrates how to connect to players and begin a game:

## Finding Players Later in the Game

When you enter Hosting Mode, the Find Players screen appears automatically. You can also return to this screen later, if needed. To do so on iPad, tap Find Players on the Host screen:

 On iPhone, tap Game Options, then tap Find Players:

## Fixing Connection Problems

If you have trouble connecting:

* Ensure that both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are turned on for all devices (host and players). You can do this using Control Center.
* The reliability of connections can be affected by a number of factors, including:
    * The distance between devices.
    * The kinds of devices connecting. For instance, the iPad Pro 9.7" does not connect to more than three devices (when in Hosting Mode) using Reliable Networking Mode. This seems to be caused by a change in hardware with that device compared to older devices.
* Try to reset the connection on both the host's device and the players' devices.
    * On the host's Find Players screen, tap the "Reset Connection" button.
    * On the players' "Not Connected to Host" screen, tap the "Reset Connection" button (which appears after several seconds).
* If none of the options listed above work, try to force Game Show Studio to quit, then relaunch it on all devices (host and players).

## About the Networking Modes

If you have a device that supports Bluetooth Low Energy (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 3rd generation or newer, iPod Touch 5th generation or newer), the host can select between two networking modes:

* Reliable Networking Mode: This mode uses Bluetooth Low Energy to connect devices, which maintains connections better and usually provides faster device-to-device communication. This mode requires all player devices to support Bluetooth Low Energy.
* Compatibility Mode: This mode uses a combination of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to connect devices, and allows older devices (such as iPad 2) to participate in games.
You can switch to Compatibility Mode by tapping "Don't See Who You're Looking For?" on the Find Players screen. If you're already in Compatibility Mode, you will see "Switch Back to Reliable Networking Mode" instead. If your device does not support Bluetooth Low Energy, you will be in Compatibility Mode by default, and you will not have an option to change it.

## Number of Devices

The maximum number of devices that can connect can vary with a number of conditions, including:

* Networking mode (Reliable Mode vs. Compatibility Mode).
* The kinds of devices connecting. For instance, the iPad Pro 9.7" does not connect to more than three devices (when in Hosting Mode) using Reliable Networking Mode. This seems to be caused by a change in hardware with that device compared to older devices.
* Other factors.

Because of this variability, there is no official maximum number of devices. Try establishing connections with the devices and conditions in which you plan to use the app to determine how many devices can connect. This can be done before you purchase Hosting Mode (as part of the hosting trial).

The developer of Game Show Studio would like to hear about your experiences using the app. Did you have trouble with a particular setup? Were you able to connect a large number of devices to a game? Send an email to [tim+connections@gameshowstudioapp.com](mailto:tim+connections@gameshowstudioapp.com) with information about:

* which devices were in the game and
* which networking mode was used

and describe your experience so that we can use this information to continue to improve the app and learn more about what the most favorable conditions are for connecting a large number of devices to Game Show Studio.
