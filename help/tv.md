Game Show Studio allows the host to show a dynamic display of game information on a TV.

## Connecting to a TV

The host can connect their device to a TV using either of two ways:

* AirPlay: Use AirPlay from the host's device to show the television display. Learn more about how to use AirPlay on [Apple's web site](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289){:target="_blank<!-- markup clean_ -->"}.
* HDMI: Use a compatible cable to connect the host's device to a television. The screen should automatically connect once the HDMI cable is connected to both the iOS device and the TV.

## Round Rules Integration

The active round can affect what is displayed on the TV. To learn how to get the most out of this feature, check out the [Round Rules page](/help/roundrules/#appearance-for-television).

## Fixing Problems

If you have trouble connecting to your TV using AirPlay, you can get more help from [Apple's web site](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289){:target="_blank<!-- markup clean_ -->"}.

If your TV display seems slow to respond while using AirPlay, try the following:

* Use HDMI to connect instead of AirPlay.
* Decrease the distance between your Apple TV and your wireless router and remove any barriers (such as walls) between them.
* Decrease the distance between your Apple TV and the host's iOS device and remove any barriers between them.
* If the Apple TV and the host's device are on different wi-fi networks, try having them join the same network.
* If the Apple TV and the host's device are on the same wi-fi network, try having them join different networks (or have one of them drop off of a network, but make sure that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are turned on for both the Apple TV and the host's device).
