## Round Rules Integration

## Fixing Problems

If you have trouble connecting to your TV using AirPlay, you can get more help from [Apple's web site](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289){:target="_blank<!-- markup clean_ -->"}.

If your TV display seems slow to respond (if the image freezes or lags behind), try the following:

* Decrease the distance between your Apple TV and your wireless router and remove any barriers (such as walls) between them. We have seen vast improvements in display performance by doing this.
* Decrease the distance between your Apple TV and the host's iOS device and remove any barriers (such as walls) between them.
* If the Apple TV and the host's device are on different wi-fi networks, try having them join the same network.
* If the Apple TV and the host's device are on the same wi-fi networks, try having them join different networks (or have one of them drop off of a network, but make sure that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are turned on for both the Apple TV and the host's device). See the section called "Use peer-to-peer AirPlay" on [this page](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204289){:target="_blank<!-- markup clean_ -->"} for details and device compatibility.
